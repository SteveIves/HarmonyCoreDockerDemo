rem This batch file publishes your Harmony Core service for deployment to a
rem hosting system, for example to an IIS server. The script does the
rem following:
rem 
rem  1. Publishes the application to a temporary folder called PUBLISH
rem
rem  2. Copies in the Traditional Bridge host program and launch script
rem
rem  3. Replaces the web.config created by the publish operation with
rem     one that sets the ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT to Production
rem
rem  4. Optionally includes the content of the SampleData folder
rem     (Only if environment variuable INCLUDE_SAMPLE_DATA=TRUE)
rem
rem  5. Optionally includes VC++ runtime files
rem     (Only if environment variable INCLUDE_C_RUNTIME=TRUE)
rem
rem  6. Optionally zips the PUBLISH folder to a date and time stamped zip file
rem     HarmonyCoreService-platform-yyyymmdd-hhmm.zip
rem     (Only if 7-zip is installed and environment variable PUBLISH_ZIP=TRUE)
rem
rem  7. Deletes the temporary PUBLISH folder
rem     (Only if the a zip file was created)
rem
rem  8. Transfers the ZIP file to a specified location via COPY or FTP.
rem     (Only if a zip file was created, and the PUBLISH_MODE=COPY
rem     and PUBLISH_DIR is set to a valid directory path, or WinSCP is
rem     installed, PUBLISH_MODE=FTP and the environment variables
rem     PUBLISH_FTP_SERVER PUBLISH_FTP_USER and PUBLISH_FTP_PASSWORD
rem     are set)
rem 
rem A good way to set these environment variables is to create a batch
rem file named Publish.Settings.bat in the main solution folder. If
rem the file is present it will be executed when this script runs.
